# OGP Data Retriver Plugin for Sublime Text 3
## Description of the Code
This is a Python 3 code for a plugin of "Sublime Text 3".

When your clipboard has a URL string, this plugin try to retrive the OGP data from the URL, process it, and then insert the string at the current cursor.

### Eg.(as of Feb. 7, 2021)
clipboard string: "https://github.com/"

inserted string: "{{< blogcard title = "GitHub: Where the world builds software" description = "GitHub is where over 56 million developers shape the future of software, together. Contribute to the open source community, manage your Git repositories, review code like a pro, track bugs and feat..." site_name = "GitHub" image = "https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/site/social-cards/github-social.png" url = "https://github.com/" >}}"

### Background
I wrote this specifically for a static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) because Hugo's shortcode does not let user retrive external data,
and there are enormous workarounds on Internet but none of them seems to me OK-ish.

## How to Install This Plugin
Download HugoBlogCard.py file to your Sublime Text 3 User directory, in my case(Mac) /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User.
Binding Keys from Preferences > Key Bindings â€“ Default menu like
```json
[
    { 
        "keys": ["ctrl+alt+b"], "command": "hugoblogcard"
    }
]
```
